year. For information about designating a principal residence and what 
qualifies as a principal residence, go to cra.gc.ca/capitalgains/ and select 
"Principal residence and other real estate", or see Chapter 6 of Guide T4037, 
Capital Gains, or Income Tax Folio S1-F3-C2, Principal Residence. 
 
For information on how to report the gain or loss on a part of your principal 
residence you used to produce income, see the section "Real estate, 
depreciable property and other properties" in Chapter 2 of Guide 4037, 
Capital Gains, and Income Tax Folio S1-F3-C2, Principal Residence. 
 
If you were not a resident of Canada for the entire time you owned the 
designated property, your period of non-residence may reduce the amount of 
the principal residence exemption or eliminate it. For more information,
