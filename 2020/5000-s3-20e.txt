Complete this section if you disposed of a property (or properties) in 2020 
for which you are claiming a principal residence exemption.

residence, such as when:

operation 
 
- you change your rental or business operation to a principal residence 
 
If you were not a resident of Canada for the entire time you owned the 
designated property, your period of non-residence may reduce or eliminate the 
amount of the principal residence exemption. For more information, call the
