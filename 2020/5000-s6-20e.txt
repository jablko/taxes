Schedule 6 
 
Canada Workers Benefit 
 
The Canada workers benefit (CWB) is a refundable tax credit that is intended 
to supplement the earnings of low-income workers. As of the 2019 tax year, 
you may choose to include or not include tax-exempt income when you calculate 
the CWB. The benefit has two parts: a basic amount and a disability 
supplement. 
 
Complete this schedule and attach it to your return to claim the CWB, if you 
met all of the following conditions in 2020: 
 
- you were a resident of Canada throughout the year 
 
- you earned working income (see Part A) 
 
- at the end of the year, you were 19 years of age or older, or you resided 
with your spouse or common-law partner or your child 
 
You cannot claim the CWB for 2020 if any of the following applies to you: 
 
- you were enrolled as a full-time student at a designated educational 
institution for a total of more than 13 weeks in the year, unless you had an 
eligible dependant at the end of the year 
 
- you were confined to a prison or similar institution for a period of at 
least 90 days during the year 
 
- you were exempt from income tax in Canada for a period in the year when you 
were an officer or servant of another country, such as a diplomat, and you 
resided in Canada, or you were a family member who resided with such a 
person, or an employee of such a person at any time in the year 
 
Notes: 
If you were married or living in a common-law relationship but did not have 
an eligible spouse (defined below) or an eligible dependant (defined below), 
complete this schedule using the instructions as if you had neither an 
eligible spouse nor an eligible dependant. 
 
If you are completing a final return for a deceased person who met the above 
conditions, you can claim the CWB for that person if the date of death was 
after June 30, 2020. 
 
Eligible spouse - For the purpose of the CWB, an eligible spouse is a person 
who meets all the following conditions: 
 
- was your cohabiting spouse or common-law partner on December 31, 2020, (or, 
if that person died in 2020, but after June 30, they were your cohabiting 
spouse or common-law partner on the date of death and you were not the 
cohabiting spouse or common-law partner of another individual on December 31, 
2020) 
 
- was a resident of Canada throughout 2020

institution for a total of more than 13 weeks in the year, unless they had an 
eligible dependant at the end of the year

least 90 days during the year 
 
- was not exempt from income tax in Canada for a period in the year when the

person who meets all the following conditions:

- was under 19 years of age and lived with you on December 31, 2020, (or, if 
that person died in 2020, but after June 30, they lived with you on the date 
of death, and would have been under 19 years of age on December 31, 2020) 
 
- was not eligible for the CWB for 2020

person can claim the basic CWB for that eligible dependant. If you cannot 
decide who will claim the basic CWB when you have an eligible spouse or an 
eligible dependant, the Canada Revenue Agency will designate who will claim 
the basic CWB.
