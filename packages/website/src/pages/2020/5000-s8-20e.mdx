Schedule 8 
 
Canada Pension Plan Contributions and Overpayment 
 
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) was amended to provide for the enhancement of 
pensions. The government of Quebec also adopted legislative amendments to 
enhance the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) in a similar way to the federal plan. 
The enhancements are funded by additional enhanced contributions, which began 
in January 2019. 
 
As an employee, your employer will already have deducted the contributions 
from your salary and wages. The contributions consist of a base and an 
enhanced amount. As a self-employed individual, you will calculate your 
required contributions (if any) on this schedule, which will include the base 
and the enhanced amounts. 
 
Complete this schedule and attach it to your return to calculate your 
required Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions or overpayment for 2020 if 
you were a resident of a province or territory other than Quebec on December 
31, 2020, and have no earned income from the province of Quebec. 
 
Do not use this schedule if any of your T4 slips have Quebec Pension Plan 
(QPP) contributions. Instead complete Form RC381, Inter-Provincial 
Calculation for CPP and QPP Contributions and Overpayments for 2020. 
 
Part 1 - Complete this part if you are electing to stop contributing to the 
CPP or revoking a prior election. 
 
Part 2 - Complete this part to determine the number of months for the CPP 
contributions calculation. 
 
Part 3 - Complete this part if you are reporting employment income. 
 
Part 4 - Complete this part if you are reporting only self-employment income 
or other earnings you are electing to pay CPP contributions on. 
 
Part 5 - Complete this part if you are reporting employment income and self-
employment income or other earnings you are electing to pay CPP contributions 
on. You must first complete Part 3. 
 
For more information, see lines 22200, 22215, 30800, and 31000 in the guide. 
 
Part 1 - Election to stop contributing to the Canada Pension Plan or 
revocation of a prior election 
 
If in 2020 you were 60 to 70 years of age, you received a CPP or QPP 
retirement pension, and you had employment and/or self-employment income, you 
were considered a CPP working beneficiary and you were required to make CPP 
contributions. However, if you were at least 65 years of age but under 70, 
you can elect to stop paying CPP contributions. 
 
If you have employment income for 2020 and elected in 2020 to stop paying CPP 
contributions or revoked in 2020 an election made in a prior year, you should 
have already completed Form CPT30, Election to Stop Contributing to the 
Canada Pension Plan or Revocation of a Prior Election, and sent it to us and 
your employer(s). 
 
If you had only self-employment income for 2020 and elect in 2020 to stop 
paying CPP contributions on your self-employment earnings, enter the month in 
2020 for which you choose to start this election in box 50372 on the next 
page. The date cannot be earlier than the month you turn 65 and you are 
receiving a CPP or QPP retirement pension. For example, if you turn 65 in 
June, you can choose any month from June to December. If you choose the month 
of June, enter 06 in box 50372 because June is the sixth month of the year. 
If in 2020 you are revoking an election made in a prior year on contributions 
on self-employment earnings, enter the month in 2020 for which you choose to 
revoke this election in box 50374 on the next page. Your election remains 
valid until you revoke it or you turn 70. If you start receiving employment 
income (other than employment income earned in Quebec) in a future year, you 
will have to complete Form CPT30 in that year for your election to remain 
valid. 
 
If you had both employment income and self-employment income in 2020 and 
wanted to elect to stop paying CPP contributions in 2020, or to revoke in 
2020 an election made in a prior year, you should have completed Form CPT30 
in 2020. An election filed using Form CPT30 applies to all income from 
pensionable earnings, including self-employment earnings, as of the first day 
of the month after the date you gave this form to your employer. If you 
completed and submitted Form CPT30 when you became employed in 2020 but your 
intent was to elect in 2020 to stop paying CPP contributions or revoke an 
election made in a prior year on your self-employment income before you 
became employed, enter the month you want to stop contributing in box 50372 
on the next page, or if you want to revoke in 2020 an election made in a 
prior year, enter the month you want to resume contributing in box 50374 on 
the next page. If you did not complete and submit Form CPT30 for 2020 when 
you became employed, you cannot elect to stop paying CPP contributions or 
revoke an election made in a prior year on your self-employment earnings for 
2020 on this schedule.
