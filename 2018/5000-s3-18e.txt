You can carry forward your net capital losses indefinitely and apply them

Principal residence 
 
Complete this section if you disposed of a property (or properties) in 2018 
that you are claiming a principal residence exemption for. 
 
In all cases, you have to get and complete Form T2091(IND), Designation of a 
property as a principal residence by an individual, or Form T1255, 
Designation of a Property as a Principal Residence by the Legal 
Representative of a Deceased Individual, whichever applies. 
 
Even if you do not sell your property, you may have a deemed disposition that 
you must report. A deemed disposition occurs when you are considered to have 
disposed of property, even though you did not actually sell it. For example, 
a deemed disposition will occur when you change how you use your principal 
residence, such as: 
 
- you change all or part of your principal residence to a rental or business 
operation 
 
- you change all or part of your rental or business operation to a principal 
residence 
 
If you were not a resident of Canada for the entire time you owned the 
designated property, your period of non-residence may reduce the amount of 
the principal residence exemption or eliminate it. For more information, call 
the CRA at 1-800-959-8281.
