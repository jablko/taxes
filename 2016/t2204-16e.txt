Employment insurance overpayment ^
 
Enter the amount from line 12 on line 450 of your return only if it is more 
than $1. However, if the amount on line 12 is greater than the amount on line 
9, enter instead the amount from line 9 on line 450. 
 
Enter the amount from line 7, 9, or 10, whichever is least, on line 312 of 
Schedule 1 and, if it applies, on line 5832 of Form 428. We may adjust your 
claim if there is an amount on line 2 and the amount on line 3 is less than

amount shown in box 55 of that slip on this line. In this case, contact 
Revenu Québec for a refund of your Provincial parental insurance plan (PPIP) 
premiums paid. However, if you are an employee who controls more than 40% of 
the voting shares of a corporation and you have entered into an agreement 
with the Canada Employment Insurance Commission through Service Canada in 
2016 to participate in the EI program for access to EI special benefits, 
claim the amount shown in box 55 on this line.
