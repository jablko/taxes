Part 2 - Complete this part to determine the number of months for the CPP 
calculation. 
 
Part 3 - Complete this part if you are reporting employment income. 
 
Part 4 - Complete this part if you are reporting only self-employment income 
or other earnings for which you are electing to pay CPP contributions. 
 
Part 5 - Complete this part if you are reporting employment income and self-
employment income or other earnings for which you are electing to pay CPP 
contributions. You must first complete Part 3. 
 
For more information, see line 222 in the guide. 
 
Part 1 - Election to stop contributing to the Canada Pension Plan or 
revocation of a prior election 
 
If in 2018 you were 60 to 70 years of age, you received a CPP or QPP 
retirement pension, and you had employment and/or self-employment income, you 
were considered a CPP working beneficiary and you were required to make CPP 
contributions. However, if you were at least 65 years of age but under 70, 
you can elect to stop paying CPP contributions. 
 
If you have employment income for 2018 and elected in 2018 to stop paying CPP 
contributions or revoked in 2018 an election made in a prior year, you should 
have already completed Form CPT30, Election to Stop Contributing to the 
Canada Pension Plan, or Revocation of a Prior Election, and sent it to the 
CRA and your employer(s). 
 
If you had only self-employment income for 2018 and elect in 2018 to stop 
paying CPP contributions on your self-employment earnings, enter in box 372 
below the month in 2018 for which you choose to start this election. The date 
cannot be earlier than the month you turn 65 and you are receiving a CPP or 
QPP retirement pension. For example, if you turn 65 in June, you can choose 
any month from June to December. If you choose the month of June, enter 06 in 
box 372 because June is the sixth month of the year. If in 2018 you are 
revoking an election made in a prior year on contributions for self-
employment earnings, enter in box 374 below the month in 2018 for which you 
choose to revoke this election. Your election remains valid until you revoke 
it or you turn 70. If you start receiving employment income (other than 
employment income earned in Quebec) in a future year, you will have to 
complete Form CPT30 in that year to keep your election valid. 
 
If you had both employment income and self-employment income in 2018 and 
wanted to elect to stop paying CPP contributions in 2018, or to revoke in 
2018 an election made in a prior year, you should have completed Form CPT30 
in 2018. An election filed using Form CPT30 applies to all income from 
pensionable earnings, including self-employment earnings, as of the first day 
of the month after the date you gave this form to your employer. If you 
completed and submitted Form CPT30 when you became employed in 2018 but your 
intent was to elect in 2018 to stop paying CPP contributions or to revoke an 
election made in a prior year on your self-employment income before you 
became employed, enter in box 372 below the month you want to stop 
contributing, or if you want to revoke in 2018 an election made in a prior 
year, enter in box 374 below the month you want to resume contributing. If 
you did not complete and submit Form CPT30 for 2018 when you became employed, 
you cannot elect to stop paying CPP contributions or revoke an election made 
in a prior year on your self-employment earnings for 2018 on this schedule. 
To be valid, an election or revocation that begins in 2018 must be filed on 
or before June 15, 2020. 
 
Box 372: I elect to stop contributing to the Canada Pension Plan on my self-
employment earnings on the first day of the month that I entered in box 372. 
(Month) ^
 
Box 374: I want to revoke an election made in a prior year to stop 
contributing to the Canada Pension Plan on my self-employment earnings and 
resume contributing on the first day of the month that I entered in box 374.
