Part 1 - Election to stop contributing to the Canada Pension Plan or 
revocation of a prior election 
 
If in 2017 you were 60 to 70 years of age, you received a CPP or QPP 
retirement pension, and you had employment and/or self-employment income, you 
were considered a CPP working beneficiary and you were required to make CPP 
contributions. However, if you were at least 65 years of age but under 70, 
you can elect to stop paying CPP contributions. 
 
If you have employment income for 2017 and elected in 2017 to stop paying CPP 
contributions or revoked in 2017 an election made in a prior year, you should 
have already completed Form CPT30, Election to Stop Contributing to the 
Canada Pension Plan, or Revocation of a Prior Election, and sent it to us and 
your employer(s). 
 
If you had only self-employment income for 2017 and elect in 2017 to stop 
paying CPP contributions on your self-employment earnings, enter the month in 
2017 for which you choose to start this election in box 372 below. The date 
cannot be earlier than the month you turn 65 and you are receiving a CPP or 
QPP retirement pension. For example, if you turn 65 in June, you can choose 
any month from June to December. If you choose the month of June, enter 06 in 
box 372 because June is the sixth month of the year. If in 2017 you are 
revoking an election made in a prior year on contributions on self-employment 
earnings, enter the month in 2017 for which you choose to revoke this 
election in box 374 below. Your election remains valid until you revoke it or 
you turn 70. If you start receiving employment income (other than employment 
income earned in Quebec) in a future year, you will have to complete Form 
CPT30 in that year for your election to remain valid. 
 
If you had both employment income and self-employment income in 2017 and 
wanted to elect to stop paying CPP contributions in 2017, or to revoke in 
2017 an election made in a prior year, you should have completed Form CPT30 
in 2017. An election filed using Form CPT30 applies to all income from 
pensionable earnings, including self-employment earnings, as of the first day 
of the month after the date you gave this form to your employer. If you 
completed and submitted Form CPT30 when you became employed in 2017, but your 
intent was to elect in 2017 to stop paying CPP contributions or revoke an 
election made in a prior year on your self-employment income before you 
became employed, enter the month you want to stop contributing in box 372 
below, or if you want to revoke in 2017 an election made in a prior year, 
enter the month you want to resume contributing in box 374 below. If you did 
not complete and submit Form CPT30 for 2017 when you became employed, you 
cannot elect to stop paying CPP contributions or revoke an election made in a 
prior year on your self-employment earnings for 2017 on this schedule. To be 
valid, an election or revocation that begins in 2017 must be filed on or 
before June 15, 2019.

employment earnings on the first day of the month that I entered in box 372.
